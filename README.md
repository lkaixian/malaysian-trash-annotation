--- Introduction ---
Malaysian Trash Annotation or *MTA* in short is a localised instance segmentation dataset designed to address the current issue of waste segregation in Southeast Asia context. Compare with other openly-sourced dataset, *MTA* is heavily designed around real-world situation where it provides polygon masking to capture the exact geometry of the trash.

--- Goal ---
To develop a high-accuracy waste segmentation model that can precisely localize objects with mainly account for real-world Malaysian environments.

--- Dataset's Version: Build 20260418 ---

* Classes: 14 (Material-based separation)
* Environment: Supermarkets (clean and ideal condition), Roadside (weathered), Food Courts (occluded/deformed).
* Hardware: Heterogeneous capture using 5 different devices (Oppo, Honor, Samsung, iPhone, Realme).
* Capture Protocol: Aspect Ratio locked at 4:3, Multi-angle (Top, Side, 45-degree) with no AI enhancements and no HDR enabled. 

Note 1:
> We overhaul the dataset's structure to now only support for material-based detection, should you split into 3 different segment in order to reach maximum accuracy of the purpose of detecting the recyclability of the trash, which are material-based, contamination-status, and object-based approach. 
> For more information, please refer to Singapore National Environment Agency guideline [here.](https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/our-services/waste-management/list-of-items-that-are-recyclable-and-not.pdf)

--- Annotation Strategy ---

The dataset is currently structured for material-based detection (Phase 1), as below:
![SOP-Build-20260418](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkaixian/malaysian-trash-annotation/refs/heads/main/Recyclable%20Material-2026-04-19-082829.png)

Future extensions include:

Object-level classification
Contamination detection

This modular approach aligns with practical waste classification systems.
